# CIT419
Repository for my CIT 419 game: "Are You Not Entertained?"


A Python virtual environment needs to be added to this project when it is pulled as the environment cannot be stored on GitHub due to size restrictions.

Currently does not work on my desktop as I do not have a Nvidia graphics card. Will check to see how I can make it use my CPU for training.
